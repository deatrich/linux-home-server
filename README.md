# Linux Home Server

If you have a Single-board computer (SBC) - such as a Raspberry Pi or
an Odroid - then this guide will help you configure a 24x7 Linux server
for home use.  Here we configure the server with Ubuntu LTS.

This guide was written using the Markdown markup language.  The flavour
of Markdown used in the guide is the Pandoc flavour, so some features in
the document (like descriptive lists) do not render correctly in the
Github flavour.  Nevertheless, you can still 
[browse the guide](https://github.com/deatrich/linux-home-server/blob/main/linux-server.md) .

A recent [Pandoc-generated PDF version of the guide](https://github.com/deatrich/linux-home-server/blob/main/generated/linux-server.pdf)
is always available as well.

This is a work in progress, so expect more sections of the guide to be
fleshed out in coming days.
